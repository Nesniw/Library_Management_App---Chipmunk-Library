# Chipmunk Library Management System

## Overview

Chipmunk Library Management System is an Android-based application designed to streamline the management of library resources. This application provides librarians with the tools needed to manage accounts, books, and lending processes efficiently, offering a robust set of features to maintain and operate a library effectively.

## Features 
- Manage Accounts: Create, update, and delete user accounts to control access and maintain user records.
- Manage Books:
    - Display Books: View a comprehensive list of all books available in the library.
    - Insert Book: Add new books to the library catalog with details.
    - Update Book Data: Edit the information of existing books to ensure the catalog is up-to-date.
    - Delete Book: Remove books from the library catalog when they are no longer available.
- Lending Books: Issue books to users, keeping track of who has borrowed what.
- Returning Books: Process the return of borrowed books and update their status in the system.
- Book Lending History: Access detailed records of book lending activities, including past and current transactions.

## Technologies Used 
- Java is used for the development of the Android application. The Android app is the primary interface through which librarians interact with the library management system.
- PHP is used for the backend of the library management system. The backend server is responsible for handling database operations, processing requests from the Android app, and sending back the appropriate responses.
